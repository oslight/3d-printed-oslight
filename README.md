# 3D Printable OSLight

## Design Files

This repository contains the files needed to 3D print an OSLight. It provides both STL and FreeCad design files in the event you wish to make modifications. 

## Software

  * Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/oslight/oslight-manifest) to build the lwm2m-light project on the lwm2m-neopixel branch

## Hardware

  * NRF52 BLE Nano 2
  * 12 LED Neopixel WRGB

## Electrical

  * NeoPixel input connect to pin 5
  * Power the NeoPixel from VDD and GND

## Print Settings

  * 20% infill with a single shell
  * PLA has been tested, but other materials should be fine.

## Assembly

  * Test fit the parts to ensure good fitment
  * Dab some CA (superglue) to hold pieces firmly in place when fitment is good
